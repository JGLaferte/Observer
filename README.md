#My take on the Design pattern Observer
```csharp

        public class ObserverManager
        {
            List<Iobserver> obsList = new List<Iobserver>();
            public void register(Iobserver ob)
            {
                obsList.Add(ob);
            }
            public void unRegister(Iobserver ob)
            {
                obsList.Remove(ob);

            }
            public void Notify<S>(S state)
            {
                foreach (Iobserver ob in obsList)
                {
                    ob.update(state);
                }
            }
        }
        public interface Iobserver
        {
            void update<S>(S sub);

        }
```
# Ho to use ?

* Implement the Iobserver for the obervable object

* Create a new instance of Observer Manager in the observed object

* Place the Notify function where is needed

* Register/unregister 

# Objectif 

| Objectif  | Solution |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Easy to use and simple | using class/interface for make instance for having less code to write   |
| Reusable | Using generic typing + no multi inheritance (c# donâ€™t support it)  |



# Why ?

Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object

is modified, its dependent objects are to be notified automatically. Observer pattern falls under 

behavioral pattern category. Think for example of twitter, followers is the observer and the followed 

is to one being observed.

# Example

Simply clone my project and test my pattern. To me, real life example is always easier to understand. 

That why I used the electricity for the example. In the project I created 2 custom component: "Switch"

and "light". You simply register a switch to a light to make it react to it.

(Switch1 is registered to light 1 and 2)
